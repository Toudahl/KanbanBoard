# KanbanBoard
A simple kanban board made as a "brush up" exercise at the beginning
of my second semester studying for my AP graduate degree in computer science.

The board uses Gong drag and drop, and newtonsoft json for persistence.

I am currently in the process of refactoring the board. When i am done with the current
functionallity, i will add more features.

// TODO: Create a way to dynamically add more boards.

// TODO: Create functionallity to add employees

// TODO: Create functionality to select an employee

// TODO: Add other types of persistence.

// TODO: Make a check on the file beeing loaded to detect what type of persistence was used, and
// automatically select the correct class to deserialize.

// TODO: Further clean up of the UI

// TODO: Create settings functionallity

     //TODO: Auto load
     
     //TODO: Default persistence type
     
     //TODO: Auto save
